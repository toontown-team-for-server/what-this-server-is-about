I am hiring people to make my idea come true my idea is Toontown being ruled over by Cogs the new toontown central is cogpocalypse central The new content that I want in this game is 5 maps filled with cog stuff and everything toontown is cog town secondarily I want cashbot outskirts aka cog nation, Dun dun dun, to lead to cashbot trainyard where instead of being squashed you can sit on the train 3rd of all I want 4 of the maps to have only cog stuff because ever since the chairman took over toontown rewritten the cogs now rule over all toontown now know as cogpocalypse central which is where toon jail replaces the trolley and a rocket replaces the gag shop
